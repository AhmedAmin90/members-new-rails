# AUTHENTICATION: Members Only!
 
> In this project, we created an exclusive clubhouse application using Ruby on Rails, including the model structure, associations, controllers, views, validations, and authentications, stylized with CSS.
- Consists of two models: User, Post.
- Only 'Sing Up' members are allowed to create posts and see others.
- Only each user is allowed to edit and delete his post.
With this application, sing up people can write their secrets, anyone without an account can see how to write the posts.
